                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 7 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     2 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.

SingleBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     2 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.
*info:     5 net(s): Could not be fixed because the net has unplaced term or invalid term for routing.

Resizing failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed because instance couldn't be resized.
*info:     6 net(s): Could not be fixed because no move is found.

                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 7 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     2 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.

SingleBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     2 net(s): Could not be fixed as the violating term's net is not routed.
*info:     5 net(s): Could not be fixed because the net has unplaced term or invalid term for routing.

Resizing failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed because instance couldn't be resized.
*info:     6 net(s): Could not be fixed because no move is found.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_parallel_arcs'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
